# Security policy

## Supported versions

The [latest release](https://qunitjs.com/#current-release) of QUnit is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.

E-mail your findings to security@jquery.com. Thanks! 

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 work days, you may escalate to the OpenJS Foundation CNA at `security@lists.openjsf.org`.

If your report is acknowledged but you receive no further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.

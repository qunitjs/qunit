# stderr
Test "hanging" took longer than 3000ms, but no timeout was set. Set QUnit.config.testTimeout or call assert.timeout() to avoid a timeout in QUnit 3. https://qunitjs.com/api/config/testTimeout/
Error: Process exited before tests finished running
Last test to run (hanging) has an async hold. Ensure all assert.async() callbacks are invoked and Promises resolve. You should also set a standard timeout via QUnit.config.testTimeout.

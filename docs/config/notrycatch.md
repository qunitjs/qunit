Disable handling of uncaught exceptions during tests.

### Description

<table>
<tr>
  <th>type</th>
  <td markdown="span">`boolean`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>default</th>
  <td markdown="span">`false`</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note" markdown="1">This option can also be controlled via the [HTML Reporter](https://qunitjs.com/intro/#in-the-browser) interface, and is supported as URL query parameter.</p>

By default, QUnit handles uncaught exceptions during test execution and reports them as test failures. This lets other tests continue running and allows reporters to summarise results.

Enabling this flag will disable this error handling, allowing you to more easily debug uncaught exceptions through developer tools.

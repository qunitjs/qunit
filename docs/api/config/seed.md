Enable randomized ordering of tests.

This option is also available as [CLI option](../../cli.md), and as URL query parameter in the [browser](../../browser.md).

When set to boolean true, or a string, QUnit will run tests in a [seeded-random order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed).

The provided string will be used as the seed in a pseudo-random number generator to ensure that results are reproducible. The randomization will also respect the [reorder](./reorder.md) option if enabled and re-run failed tests first without randomizing them.

Randomly ordering your tests can help identify non-atomic tests which either depend on a previous test or are leaking state to subsequent tests.

If `seed` is boolean true (or set as URL query parameter without a value), then QUnit will generate on-demand a new random value to use as seed. You can then read the seed from `QUnit.config.seed` at runtime, and use it to reproduce the same test sequence later.

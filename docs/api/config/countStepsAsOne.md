If you have tests that use both `assert.expect()` and `assert.step()` with [`assert.verifySteps()`](../assert/verifySteps.md) in the same test, you may encounter the following warning on QUnit 2.x:

```
Counting each assert.step() for assert.expect() is changing
in QUnit 3.0. Omit assert.expect() from tests that use assert.step(),
or enable QUnit.config.countStepsAsOne to prepare for the upgrade.
```

Refer to [assert.expect(): Migration guide](../assert/expect.md#migration-guide) for before and after examples.
